        <h2 style="color: black">Positioning</h2>
        <p><strong>Centre</strong></p>
        <p> The centre player of the team is usually the tallest and strongest player. They sit under the rim of the hoops and goes for layups and rebounds.</p>
        <p><em> Examples - Shaquille Oâ€™Neal, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeMarcus Cousins, Rudy Gobert </em></p>
        <p><strong> Power Forward</strong></p>
<p>Power forwards are generally the second tallest player. Like a centre they are more versatile; working around all positions but up close to the ring. </p>
<p><em>Examples - Anthony Davis, Draymond Green, Paul Millsap</em></p>
<p><strong>Small Forward</strong></p>
<p>Usually a shorter player they need to be able to drive for the ring. Must be a consistent shooter to be able to take long shots. </p>
<p><em>Examples - Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard</em></p>
<p><strong>Shooting Guard</strong></p>
<p>The shooting guard is the team's best shooter usually positioned around the 3 point line. They wait ready for the ball to be kicked out to them for a shot. They will be a threat to the opponent as they will be able to score from anywhere on the court.</p>
<p><em> Examples - James Harden, Devin Booker, Luka Doncic </em></p>
<p><strong>Point Guard</strong></p>
<p>Point guards are the best ball handlers on the team and act as a coach for the team on the court. They need to have good court vision as they are incharge of directing plays and organising their team mates. </p>
<p><em>Examples - Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul </em></p>
